    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Heat the milk!
            </strong>
            Heat the milk in a small saucepan until a few bubbles form around the edge. Remove from heat and stir margarine until melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Prepare a mixture!
            </strong>
            Combine 2 1/4 cups of flour, white sugar, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add the milk mixture, water and egg. Beat well.
            Add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour, half cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Beat the dough!
            </strong>
            Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let it
            rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Work that cinnamon!
            </strong>
            Mix the brown sugar, margarine and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Let's get hot!
            </strong>
            Preheat the oven to 375 ºF/ 190 ºC. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Roll the dough!
            </strong>
            Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 12x9 inch rectangle. Spread the cinnamon mixture over the dough, and sprinkle
            with raisins.         
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Now it's a roll!
            </strong>
            Roll up dough and pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 equal rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Get that juice!
            </strong>
            Place cut-side up in the prepared muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Baking time!
            </strong>
            Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until browned. Remove rolls from muffin cups to cool on
            a wire rack. Serve warm.
