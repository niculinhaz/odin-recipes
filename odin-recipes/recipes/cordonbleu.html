                Prep the Chicken!!
            </strong>
            Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound then with a mallet to even and thin the pieces.
            Then, season it thoroughly with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Roll!
            </strong>
            Top each piece of chicken with a slice of swiss cheese and a slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically
            so that ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Bread and bake!
            </strong>
            Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake 
            until the chicken isn't pink anymore, then top each rol with half a slice of swiss, and continue baking until
            the cheese melt.
